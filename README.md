This is a calculator made for phones. 

It uses Reverse Polish Notation, which means you need to enter numbers to a stack before you can do any calculus. 

Using the numpad you can add any number you desire, pressing the enter button will then add that number to a stack that remains visible in the top row. 

To do calculus on the stack, you need to have at least 2 different numbers. The app currently supports multiplication, division, subtraction and addition. 

After having performed an operation, the stack will update accordingly. You can now proceed to add more numbers to the stack, or do more operations on the stack.
